Hi! Welcome to my 2D tag readme.

2DTag is a simple game I developed in 2022 demonstrating the four principles of object oriented programming: encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction.

The game is based on the campus where I go to university. Players either spawn as a TA or as a student and must either find the student or collect the documents. It can include up to two players for a tag - like mechanism, but can otherwise be played alone. Some additional components to the gameplay I would add in the future would be implementing path planning and automation to the second player, designing a better random map generation algorithm, and increasing game complexity. 

The files provided range from underlying game mechanics to player and map design. 
RandomUtils was provided to me to modify, and I designed the implementation of and wrote all other files. 

Enjoy!
